## Shop Prices vs Rewards

### Early Items
- Healing Potion (30HP): 30g
- Wooden Sword (+3 ATK): 50g
- Leather Armor (+2 DEF): 50g

### Mid-tier
- Iron Sword (+5 ATK): 200g
- Chainmail (+4 DEF): 200g
- Large Healing Potion (60HP): 80g

### End-game
- Magic Sword (+8 ATK): 800g (limited stock)
- Dragon Scale Armor (+8 DEF): 1000g (limited stock)

## Balance Issues Identified:

### ✅ GOOD:
1. Early game (Slime/Wolf) is very forgiving
2. Clear progression curve
3. Shop prices feel reasonable for early game

### ⚠️ CONCERNS:
1. **Mountain monsters (Golem) might be too hard without mid-tier gear**
   - Player needs ~800-1000g to afford Iron Sword + Chainmail
   - That's many battles!
   
2. **Dragon fight requires end-game gear**
   - Need Magic Sword + Dragon Scale (~1800g total)
   - Or be very high level
   
3. **Gold economy might be slow**
   - No gold drops from monsters (only loot)
   - Only way to get gold is selling loot or dragon reward
   
4. **XP curve unknown**
   - How many levels needed to beat dragon?
   - Level 1 → 2 requires 20 XP (2 wolves or 4 slimes)

## Recommendations:

1. **Add gold drops to monsters** (5-15g per fight)
2. **Increase XP rewards slightly** or reduce XP needed per level
3. **Consider nerfing Golem** (HP: 50 → 40, DEF: 12 → 10)
4. **Make encounters less punishing** if player dies

Current State: **Playable but grindy mid-game**
